# Team Generator

##Introduction
This is a personal project using the Laravel framework to create a web app. The app is currently under development: at the time of writing, it allows users to sign-up, login, rate players and generate fair teams based on those ratings. 

The eventual aim is create an anonymous rating system, whereby users can log in and rate the players in their group. The teams will then be generated using some algorithm that takes into account the ratings from all users. The idea is that everyone will have had a say and the teams will be created somewhat more objectively!
